This is the official README of the AXR Prototype!

The prototype is split into two distinct parts:
	- Core: this is the cross-platform library
	- Test App: It is a mac application that uses the library to render files and perform tests


Build instructions
===========================================

First, we are going to compile the core library:

1 - Go to http://expat.sourceforge.net/ and download Expat, install it according to	their
	instructions

2 - Go to http://cairographics.org/ and download Cairo*, install it according to their 
	instructions.

3 - Open the Xcode 4 project in the "core" folder. Hit build. If it doesn't work check if
	all the necessary headers are added to the project (not red) and that you are linking
	to libexpat.a and libcairo*

The core library is actually a direct dependency in the Test App project, so it will be built
automatically together with the Test App. You can find the Xcode 4 project in the "Test App" folder.

//FIXME: test if this works and continue writing this to use automake


*this step is not necessary yet, but will be very soon
