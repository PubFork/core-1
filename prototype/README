This is the official README of the AXR Prototype!

It is being implemented as a Mac app for testing purposes, since that's the system I'm working on.
If you want to build it on Windows or Linux and have any experience in working on those systems,
please let me know!

On opening the app it will ask you for an HSS file, and then print out all the statements it finds.
After that, you have two buttons, each one loads a new file, and either prints statements or tokens.
The output will appear in Console.app.

For XML parsing I'll use the Expat parser, so I think that to build successfully you'll need to
install it first, since the headers include it from the standard location <expat.h>

The core library is being built in platform-independent c++. It has no external dependencies.
Right now, I'm working on the tokenizer, parser, and the general skeleton of objects. The last ones
are still in the early stages.

The test HSS files I'm using are inside the "mac" folder.
