This is the official README of the AXR project.

I'm starting with the development now. If you want to help me out in building the initial prototype email me on veosotano [at] gmail [dot] com

The official website for the project is http://axr.vg , where you can find the Mission Statement and read the working draft of the specification. The plan is to integrate a forum in the site, where we could discuss syntax, development, performance and organizational issues.

I could really need a hand with this. If you have experience with PHP open source forum software (such as Vanilla) please contact me, it would really help me to build this community faster.

Meanwhile, please join our mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/axr-main) and ask questions, discuss features, contribute, etc.

Cheers,
Miro Keller
