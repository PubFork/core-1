This is the official README of the AXR project.

I have started with the development of the prototype, it is being written in C++.

Please read the README inside the "prototype" folder to know more about the current state of the prototype.
If you want to help coding, please contact me on veosotano [at] gmail [dot] com or on

The official website for the project is http://axr.vg , where you can find the Mission Statement and read
the working draft of the specification.

I could really need a hand with this. For example, if you have experience with PHP open source forum software (such as
Vanilla) please contact me, it would really help me to build this community faster.

Meanwhile, please join our mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/axr-main) and ask questions, discuss
features, contribute, etc.

Cheers,
Miro Keller
